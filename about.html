                Kotoba is a fun word game where you have six tries to guess the word of the day. 
                A green square means that you guessed a correct letter in the correct location. A yellow square means the letter is correct but in the wrong location.
                Everyone in the world gets the same word so you can compete with your friends to see who can guess it in the least amount of tries!
