>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable


For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Kotoba is a simple fun word game where everyday a random 6 letter word is chosen. Players then have 6 tries to guess the word. When they get the word wrong Kotoba will tell them if any letters were correct and in the correct spot or correct and in the wrong spot. Because the word is the same for everyone, players can compete against their friends to see who can guess the word in the least attempts.

### Design

![Design Sketch](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97bcbef5-208d-4bc4-ab74-285882a4b840)



### Key features

- Random six letter word chosen every day
- System to guess and show which letters are correct and in the right location for every guess
- Visual grid to show how many guesses are left
- Ability to track how many people have solved the daily word displayed in real time
- Tracks each player so refreshing the page keeps your guesses for the day
- Ability to do practice words that aren't the daily word

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - For structure of application. Two pages, one for the daily word and one for the practice words.
- **CSS** - For styling the page and displaying the correct colors for correct and incorrect letters.
- **React** - Displays how many people have solved the daily word.
- **Service** - Keeps track of what the daily word is and changes it to a new random word every day. Also keeps track of how many users have solved the daily word.
- **DB/Login** - Stores users and keeps track of users guesses for the day. Users can't refresh page to get new set of guesses.
- **WebSocket** - As more people solve the daily word the counter will increase for everyone.
